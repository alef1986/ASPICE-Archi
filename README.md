*DISCLAIMER*

This is the digital version of the [Automotive SPICE Process Reference Model](http://www.automotivespice.com/fileadmin/software-download/AutomotiveSPICE_PAM_31.pdf)). This is not an official digitisation: [VDA QMC](https://vda-qmc.de/) (author of Automotive SPICE document) is not related to this digitisation. Purpose of this resource is to enable community work with ASPICE Process Reference Model and to demonstrate benefits of its digitisation. It doesn't mean to replace the original ASPICE standard. It also doesn't mean to be used as end product - its contents might contain unintentional differences to the original ASPICE.
