The test specification shall be suitable to provide evidence for compliance of the integrated software items with the software architectural design.&#xD;&#xA;NOTE 1: Compliance to the architectural design means that the specified integration tests are suitable to prove that the interfaces between the software units and between the software items fulfill the specification given by the software architectural design.&#xD;&#xA;NOTE 2: The software integration test cases may focus on&#xD;&#xA;• the correct dataflow between software items&#xD;&#xA;• the timeliness and timing dependencies of dataflow between software items&#xD;&#xA;• the correct interpretation of data by all software items using an interface&#xD;&#xA;• the dynamic interaction between software items&#xD;&#xA;• the compliance to resource consumption objectives of interfaces"/>
