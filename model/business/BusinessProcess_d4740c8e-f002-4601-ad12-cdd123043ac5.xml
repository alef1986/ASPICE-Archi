    documentation="Consequent changes to the process are defined and planned.&#xD;&#xA;NOTE 6: Process changes may only be possible if the complete supply chain improves (all relevant parties).&#xD;&#xA;NOTE 7: Traditionally process changes are mostly applied to new projects. Within the automotive industry, changes could be implemented per project phase (e.g. product sample phases A, B, C), yielding a higher improvement rate. Also, the principle of low hanging fruit (that is implementing easy improvements first) may be considered when planning process changes.&#xD;&#xA;NOTE 8: Improvements may be planned in continuous incremental small steps. Also, improvements are usually piloted before roll out at the organization."/>
