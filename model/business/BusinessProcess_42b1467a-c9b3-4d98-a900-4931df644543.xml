    documentation="Develop the test specification for system integration test including the test cases for each integration step of a system item according to the system integration test strategy. The test specification shall be suitable to provide evidence for compliance of the integrated system items with the system architectural design.&#xD;&#xA;NOTE 1: The interface descriptions between system elements are an input for the system integration test cases.&#xD;&#xA;NOTE 2: Compliance to the architectural design means that the specified integration tests are suitable to prove that the interfaces between the system items fulfill the specification given by the system architectural design.&#xD;&#xA;NOTE 3: The system integration test cases may focus on&#xD;&#xA;• the correct signal flow between system items&#xD;&#xA;• the timeliness and timing dependencies of signal flow between system items&#xD;&#xA;• the correct interpretation of signals by all system items using an interface&#xD;&#xA;• the dynamic interaction between system items&#xD;&#xA;NOTE 4: The system integration test may be supported using simulation of the environment (e.g. Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation, vehicle network simulations, digital mock-up)."/>
